# XAP2 Processor Module

Ghidra processor module for the [CSR XAP2 processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAP_processor). Created to analyze the firmware for the [JBL Flip 3](https://www.amazon.com/JBL-FLIP3-Bluetooth-Speaker-Black/dp/B010RWAIAC).

There are quite a few things I guessed on or fudged here but it seems to work well enough for decompilation.
